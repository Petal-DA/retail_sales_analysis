# Retail Sales Data Analysis

A data analytics project exploring the relationship between promotional markdowns, holidays, and weekly retail sales using historical data from 45 stores. This project uses Python (including Pandas, Plotly and Seaborn) to extract insights that support strategic decisions in retail performance and marketing planning.

The dataset includes:
- `stores_data_set.csv` — store type and size
- `features_data_set.csv` — markdowns, CPI, fuel price, temperature, unemployment, and holiday indicators
- `sales_data_set.csv` — weekly sales by store and department

Each file shares a common `Store` and `Date` column for merging.

- Identify the impact of holidays and markdowns on weekly sales
- Understand which store types and departments perform best
- Explore correlations between economic indicators and sales
